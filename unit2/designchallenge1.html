<h1>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h1>
<p>The websites that inpsire me are <a href="http://www.kano.me" target="_blank">Kano</a> and <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org" target="_blank">World Wildlife Fund</a>.</p>
<h1>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h1>
<a href="http://www.kano.me" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amygin/amygin.github.io/master/unit2-Kano.png" width="600"></a>
<p>Kano's uses a single column with plenty of negative space to feature it's main content. This design forces the viewer's eyes to stay centered, which works well when there is simple content to focus on. At the bottom of the site, it tries to spread its information throughout the width of the browser while maintaining balance. Because viewer eyes were fixated on the center through out the entire page, items to the right are lost. If you force viewers to keep their eyes in the center for almost the entire page, all of your content below have to remain centered.</p>
<a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amygin/amygin.github.io/master/unit2-WWF.png" width="600"></a>
<p>World Wildlife Fund uses various amounts of columns to organize its content. There is little to no negative space that can take the viewer's eyes away from the main content. Size is used to create a focal point but its size and side navigation might lead views to not scroll down.</p>
<h1>What makes them similar and different?</h1>

<p>Each website have a focal point but uses two different techniques. Kano uses negative space while World Wildlife Fund uses size to create a focal point. Both website uses color to point out their CTAs and place them on the top right corner. Font size creates hierarchy of text viewers should read first.</p>
<h1>Sketches</h1>
<p>Inspired by both websites, here are sketches of 2 design concepts.</p>
